# TD-MPC_Ablation-Study
TD-MPC Paper Replication and Ablation Study

---

In this study, we tested 3 hypotheses stated by the authors of the model-based RL algorithm, called TD-MPC, but for which no code was provided. We also checked whether our findings coincide with the authors' statements or not (it turned out that they are not the same in some cases).


**Hypotheses:**

âœ… **Transfer Learning:** does the knowledge the agent learns transfer between somewhat similar tasks or not?

âœ… **Latent predictor vs. State predictor:** is it better to model the dynamics of the environment itself or the dynamics of the representation of the environment in latent space?

âœ… **Regularization: Latent Consistency vs. Reconstruction vs. No Regularization:** loss regularization ablation study
